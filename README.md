In this project, I have analyzed data recorded in the context of online undergraduate
courses offered by the Open University in the UK. It is aim to build the model that will form
the backbone of an Early Warning System (EWS) for future offerings of online courses at the
Open University. Ideally, the universityâ€™s administrators would like a system that works for any
course although it is up to myself to decide if this is viable.

Model Interpretability methods are used in this project.
